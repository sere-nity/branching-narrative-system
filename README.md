# Branching Narrative System

## Inspiration & Motivation
Inspired by Disco Elysium's narrative depth and dialogue mechanics, this project experiments with modular story systems in Unity. It also explores integration with Articy Draft for flexible content authoring and management.

## Technical Approach
- Custom Unity runtime parses and displays Articy Draft story graphs
- Isometric camera and navigation prototype
- Dialog UI system enables dynamic scrolling and branching conversations

## Demo

## Limitations & Future Work
- UI and visuals use placeholders; goal was rapid iteration
- Dialogue system supports basic branching, but could be extended (choices, variables, save/load)
- Planned improvements: UI polish, accessibility features, richer narrative tools, and final art integration
