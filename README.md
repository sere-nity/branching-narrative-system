# Branching Narrative System

## Inspiration & Motivation
Inspired by Disco Elysium's narrative depth and dialogue mechanics, this project allows writers to write non-linear, branching stories for games. 


## Technical Approach
I first integrated an external writing tool - Articy Draft - with Unity

- Isometric camera and navigation prototype
- Dialog UI system enables dynamic scrolling and branching conversations

## Demo

*Isometric scene with live scrolling dialogue (UI and visuals are in early/prototype stage).*  

## Limitations & Future Work
- UI and visuals use placeholders; goal was rapid iteration
- Dialogue system supports basic branching, but could be extended (choices, variables, save/load)
- Planned improvements: UI polish, accessibility features, richer narrative tools, and final art integration
